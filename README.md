# UnityEncryptedNetwork

## This repository is:
- A demonstration of a simple networked Unity game running with a Flask server
- A demonstration of encrypting multiplayer network traffic in Unity + Flask

## You can:
- Check out my full written report in the "Reports" folder
- Run the demo for yourself! You can find a windows build in releases

## If you wanna see how the encryption works...
All of the network/encryption-related stuff is in two files:
- Server/app.py is the only file that drives the server
- EncryptDemo/Assets/_Scripts/NetworkManager.cs manages networking/encryption on the client side
